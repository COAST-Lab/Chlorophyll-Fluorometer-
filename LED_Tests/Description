This folder contains information on the LED Tests performed with the chrlorophyll fluorometer prototype. 
These tests measure the Lux and visible values obtained from the tsl2591 light sensor when the LED light is shown directly onto it and when it is turned off.
An aw9523 is used to supply a constant current to the LED light
